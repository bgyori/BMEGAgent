BMEG credentials can be set in two ways:

1) By locating a bmeg_credentials.json file here.
2) By setting up the related environment variables.

In the json fields the followings fields must be set: OauthEmail, OauthAccessToken, OauthExpires.
If the json file is missing BMEGAOauthEmail, BMEGAOauthAccessToken, BMEGAOauthExpires environment
variables must be set respectively. The missing json file will be created from these environment
variables in that case.
